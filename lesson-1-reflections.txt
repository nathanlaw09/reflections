1. Using diff to Find Bugs

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    

-It's an easy way to find errors/typos between different 	versions of files so that you can save a lot of time and 	headaches & create working code!

2. Using History for Efficiency

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

-Being able to go back to an earlier file state if you 		goof up could be very handy. It could be nice to compare 	what works/doesnt work, and what different things looked 	like and what output was created.

3. Manual Commits

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

-Choosing your own time to save commits gives the 			to select when it is important to commit & a 		rationale/grouping to the commit. auto-saving could be 		random.

4. Multi-File Commits

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

-Because many projects require changes to multiple files 		to implement one idea. Google docs isn't about writing 	code which takes multiple files to make one thing 	happen. Google docs is a word document or a presentation...etc.

5. Using Git to View History

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

-Git log shows the commits (saves) that have been made 		over time and git diff shows the differences between 2 		commits.

6.Confidence from Version Control

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

-You know that if you goof up you can always go back and 		find the cause of the break and fix it.

7. How Do You Want to Use Git?

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

-For my next Front-End Web Developer classes and personal projects. I can see how Git could be lovely to use- at the moment I'm worried about differences in setup/operation between OSX/Windows and my PC reality vs. what the videos show. It took a fair amount of effort to setup Git & have sublime text work due to errors.
