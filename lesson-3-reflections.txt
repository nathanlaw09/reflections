1. Using a remote repository



When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?



-When you are collaborating with others on a project or want to share a project for feedback. 
You might also want to use a remote repository in order to have your repository saved somewhere
in addition to your local computer.

2. Manual vs. automatic pull

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-Git could pull changes way more often than you want & before the changes are ready to be shared.
